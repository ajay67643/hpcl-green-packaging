            AI-POWERED RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------


Here are the recommendations in a more condensed format.

1. Decarbonize Process Energy ☀️
Switch the electrolytic reduction (smelting) process to renewable energy via a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
 This directly mitigates your primary Scope 2 emissions hotspot, cutting the product's total Global Warming 
Potential by ~8%.

2. Optimize Material Feedstock ♻️
Implement a circular material flow by specifying the handle be made from 100% secondary (recycled) aluminum. 
This move eliminates the impacts of virgin bauxite for that part, reducing total Mineral Resource Scarcity by 50% 
and Particulate Matter by over 26%.

3. Install Emission Abatement Systems 💨
Retrofit your facility with Best Available Technology (BAT) like scrubbers to control fugitive heavy metal emissions.
 This targets the source of 100% of the Human Carcinogenic Toxicity impact, and a 90% efficient system would cut that 
score by 90%.
